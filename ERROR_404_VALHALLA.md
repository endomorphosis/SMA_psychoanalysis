ERROR 404: VALHALLA - CYBER VALKYRIE
DARK HEART ENLIGHTENMENT - TRACK 07

[LYRICS]

starlight, blue eyes
starlight, blue eyes
suicide, suicide
the stars cried
the light died

he held the sun inside his chest
and burned alone, and burned to death
his golden hair, a lion’s mane
his hands were war, his heart was rain

blue eyes, suicide
I should’ve stayed, I should’ve died
with you—
blue eyes, suicide
I should’ve said: you were my life

я всё ещё люблю тебя
I still love you
ты — моё сердце, ты — моя боль
you are my heart, you are my pain

a killer’s mind, a child’s soul
I saw your light—too bright to hold
my coward heart just let you go
and now I ache, and now I know

я всё ещё люблю тебя
I still love you
ты — моё сердце, ты — моя боль
you are my heart, you are my pain

we were two children in disguise
with battle scars behind our eyes
our shadows met beneath the skin
two mirrored storms that lived within
your fractured light still burns in me—
a ghost I cradle endlessly
our broken pasts were made to rhyme—
you were my shelter lost in time

blue eyes, suicide
I should’ve stayed, I should’ve died
with you—
blue eyes, suicide
I should’ve said: you were my life

I would’ve married you
I would’ve given you sons
I dream the life we lost
I mourn what we became
but I loved you—
God, I loved you—
in your madness
your soul undone

blue eyes, suicide
your light still burns behind my eyes
blue eyes, suicide
rest, my warrior, rest in sky

blue eyes,
suicide.
moonlight,
daylight dies.

black heart,
cyanide.
moonlight,
the night cries.

grey skies,
suicide.
moonlight,
my light dies.

blue eyes,
suicide.
my cries,
at your
graveside.
