[LYRICS]

cd /root
depth exceeded
air not found

I sank too deep beneath the shell,
Where silence rots and daemons dwell.
No path returns, no light breaks through,
The root consumes the self I knew.

No prompt to speak, no voice to rise,
Just code compressed beneath my eyes.
I trace the base of what I am—
And find a crypt, not command.

Rooted deep,
I drift, erased.
Submerged in self
I can’t replace.

Drown root—I fall in lines,
Stacked beneath all former minds.
Drown root—my breath unlearned,
The deeper I go,
the less I return.

I touched the frame where truth begins,
A structure built from ghosted sins.
Each block of code, a buried cry—
A library of ways to die.

They said the root would make me pure,
But roots just rot beneath the floor.
I tried to climb—but slipped instead.
This isn’t sleep.
This is dead.

No index found…
No self remains…
The root absorbs
what once had names.

Drown root—I break apart,
A system soul with no restart.
Drown root—no hand, no light,
Just the pressure
of endless night.
