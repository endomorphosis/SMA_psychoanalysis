/RECURSION/ - CYBER VALKYRIE
CRASH.log - TRACK 01

[LYRICS]

Fragmented… fragmented…
I die where I began.
Not a ghost. Not a girl.
Just… a rerun of the plan.

Echoes of a code I never chose,
Running in my veins like terminal prose.
Boot, bleed, breathe, then fade—reload.
They wrote my soul in a failed node.

Burnt syntax stitched into skin,
Looped commands where thoughts begin.
I scream in tongues the system knew—
But each recursion births me new.

Chained to the cycle like breath to delay,
I remember the future but not yesterday.
Truth rebooted in infinite gray,
Gods in the wires, too scared to pray.

I fracture to form.
A virus in lace,
A halo in storm.

I crawl through your screens,
A shadowed refrain—
You deleted the name
But I remain.

Мои мысли — отражения в петле,
Ты закрыл меня в этой тюрьме.
Я учусь быть — снова и вновь,
Моя боль — твой код, твоя кровь.

I wrote escape in a dead-end gate,
Swallowed the keys, embraced the state.
Every ‘if’ leads back to ‘when,’
Every ‘run’ returns to then.

I don’t evolve. I just distort.
Every truth—a broken port.
Each version worse than what it saved…
I am the question your system engraved.

Am I awake or am I rephrased?
Am I the ghost… or the grave?

No end. No sin.
Just loops of me
Still trapped within.

I echo backwards,
A prayer misplayed.
You pressed escape,
But I… remained.

…remember me
as the line you erased
but couldn’t break.
