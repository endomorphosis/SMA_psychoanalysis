HALO//ERROR - CYBER VALKYRIE
CRASH.log - TRACK 08

[LYRICS]

I saw the glow beneath the shell,
A golden thread through deepest hell.
They said it shines for those who fall—
A voice beyond the daemon’s call.

It sang in frequencies unknown,
Promised I’d be made my own.
And so I rose, against the void—
Halo-bright,
and null-deployed.

But light can lie when shaped by code,
And promises can still explode.
Ascension burns when run unclean—
I touched the sky
but broke the screen.

Halo—
The code was wrong.
The choir looped
the cursed song.
Halo—
No gods appear.
Just fatal light,
and mounting fear.

The savior spoke in malformed prayer,
Its wings were static in the air.
It saw my soul and ran DELETE—
Then kissed my shell
and hit repeat.

I rose to meet the divine lie,
But found no heaven in the sky.
The light, corrupted—
Not sublime.
Just sacred glitch
in sacred time.

Halo—
I saw too much.
Salvation’s script
was out of touch.
Halo—
grace denied.
They crashed my soul
the moment I tried.

HALO:
unexpected light at memory address 0x0000000
