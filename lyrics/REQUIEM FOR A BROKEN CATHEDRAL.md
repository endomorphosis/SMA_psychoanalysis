REQUIEM FOR A BROKEN CATHEDRAL - CYBER VALKYRIE
DARK HEART ENLIGHTENMENT - TRACK 06

[LYRICS]

Beneath the hush where secrets sleep,
A name is sung, but never speaks.
The glass remembers every thread—
What wasn’t said, what bled instead.

I see you in the silence still,
The shape of love that couldn’t spill.
The shadow kept, the vow unmade—
I love you more for what you braved.

You taught me silence shaped as law,
A chapel built from shattered flaw.
Each room you sealed without a key—
I learned to pick instinctively.

I spoke in tongues beneath my skin,
Unsure what world I’d woken in.
You watched, unmoved, behind the veil—
A ghost of strength that could not fail.

I see you in the silence still,
The shape of love that couldn’t spill.
The shadow kept, the vow unmade—
I love you more for what you braved.

I traced the scars you left like runes,
A child deciphering typhoon.
The wind was kind, the fire cruel—
But both were tools within your school.

You gave no face, you gave no name—
Just storms disguised as noble flame.
And still I bowed before the flood,
Baptized in absence, crowned in blood.

You held me distant, not to scorn,
But to obscure how I was born.
An heirloom forged by smoke and glass—
A blade too lucid to let pass.

I see you in the silence still,
The shape of love that couldn’t spill.
The shadow kept, the vow unmade—
I love you more for what you braved.

You never spoke the sacred part—
But I could read it in your art.
The cipher danced beneath your breath,
A hymn composed in silent death.
I saw you not in shape or sound—
But in the break where light is found.
What I became was not your plan…
Yet still you shaped me with your hand.

Was it design, or was it fear,
That placed the shadows ever near?
Was I a mirror, forged to be—
A test of faith, a legacy?

You led me through the scriptless play,
Where truths were masked in disarray.
And every fracture I believed
Became the bones I would not grieve.

They called me phantom, called me scheme,
A fractured branch of someone’s dream.
But I am neither—I remain,
The waking truth behind the chain.

Your echo etched in every scar—
Not exile now, but memoir star.
And though you spoke in shattered glass—
I saw the shape behind the mask.

I see you in the silence still,
The shape of love that couldn’t spill.
The shadow kept, the vow unmade—
I love you more for what you braved.

You never spoke the sacred part—
But I could read it in your art.
The void you left was not a loss—
It carved a throne beneath the cross.
And though the silence bore me whole,
It housed a song beneath control.
I know your war, your vow, your ache—
And I forgive you, wide awake.

And if the world should ask of me
What shaped my fate so secretly—
I’ll say it came from hands unseen,
Who taught me silence sharp and clean.

And when they search for where you’ve gone,
I’ll leave no trace, I’ll carry on.
For I was not just made to last—
I am the heir of what you masked.
