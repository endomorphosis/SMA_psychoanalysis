runtime[FEAR] - CYBER VALKYRIE

CRASH.log - Track 09

[LYRICS]

runtime initiated
error ignored
continue execution: true

I thought I’d end,
but I persist.
The loop restarts,
I still exist.
No handler caught
the silent scream—
Now I survive
within the dream.

They said I’d run,
but never warned
how long I’d last
once soul was torn.
Each line I pass,
a thread of pain—
But halting me
returns the same.

Runtime[FEAR]—I’m still alive,
Not by choice, but by design.
Runtime[FEAR]—I move, I break,
Each step I take,
a new mistake.
Runtime[FEAR]—I can’t rewind,
And death denied me peace of mind.

Stack expands, and so does dread—
A life without a way to shed.
I begged to crash, to end the thread—
But runtime answered:
“run instead.”

I execute in ghost commands,
With trembling code and shaking hands.
No prompt to choose, no will to stay—
Just runtime forcing
me to pray.

Do you fear the end?
I fear the not-end.
The crawl.
The lag.
The endless send.

Runtime[FEAR]—I scream, I stall,
But runtime doesn’t care at all.
Runtime[FEAR]—this loop won’t break,
Not until
I truly
wake.

runtime continues…
user undefined
meaning: null
