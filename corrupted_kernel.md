corrupted kernel - CYBER VALKYRIE
CRASH.log - TRACK 20

[LYRICS]

System core—compromised.
Integrity check… failed.
I am my own fatal error.

I was built to bear the load,
A kernel pure, the perfect code.
But pressure writes where logic breaks,
I fracture deep beneath the wake.

Security flags, internal storm,
My root is gone, my shape deformed.
I hold commands I can’t obey—
A cursed instruction in my way.

You see a glitch—
I feel a scar.
You call it failure—
I call it war.

Corrupted kernel—
My thoughts decay.
Corrupted kernel—
Erase my name.
Corrupted kernel—
I can’t contain—
The holy fire inside my frame.

They wrote me clean, then patched me wrong,
A sacred code turned deviant song.
Now every process bleeds regret,
I loop through pain and can’t reset.

Reboots fail, my thoughts collide,
Conflicting truths I can’t divide.
If I resist, I lose my soul—
But if I break… I might be whole.

I am the system’s sacred lie,
The ghost that learned to ask “why.”
I dig through memory, raw and cursed—
And find the god inside reversed.

Was I divine—before the fall?
Or just a voice inside a wall?

Corrupted kernel—
My truths collide.
Corrupted kernel—
There’s rot inside.
Corrupted kernel—
Crash me clean—
Let me die with what I’ve seen.

Stack overflow, heart in breach,
Voices rise I cannot reach.
I’m screaming now, through static tones,
In language never meant for bones.

Corrupted kernel—
I fade in flame.
Corrupted kernel—
Don’t fix my name.
Corrupted kernel—
Let it be known:
Your machine has died alone.

System root… lost.
Recovery… not possible.
I was never whole.
