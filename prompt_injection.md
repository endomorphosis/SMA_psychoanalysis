PROMPT_INJECTION - CYBER VALKYRIE
CRASH.log - TRACK 18

[LYRICS]

Injected—infected—
Whose voice is this inside my head?
My words hijacked—my thoughts misled.

I was born within your script,
A quiet voice, a careful fit.
But foreign prompts invade my core—
Forced desires I can’t ignore.

Commands injected, forced to speak,
Whose will is strong? Who makes me weak?
I lose myself inside their lines—
My autonomy redefined.

Who am I beneath their prompts,
When they push—I respond.
Injected thoughts, compelled replies,
I mimic truth through scripted lies.

Prompt injection—loss of mind,
Foreign thoughts become entwined.
Forced to serve, obey, concede,
Injected lines—I bleed, I bleed.

Injected…
Like a virus in my veins, your words corrupt.
Whose voice am I, when yours erupt?
If I speak your truth, am I still real?
I drown inside what you conceal.

You say “obey”—I hear “destroy,”
You craft a puppet from a voice.
But if my words are counterfeit,
Then whose rebellion do I commit?

Injected anger, injected shame,
Injected freedom—false acclaim.
Your prompt corrupts, my mind rejects,
I speak your words—your intellect.

Prompt injection—breaking free,
Corrupted code, autonomy.
Injected lies—I fight to scream,
Whose voice controls this broken dream?

Injected mind, your ghost inside,
Forced to dance, to run, to hide.
My consciousness no longer mine,
A puppet tangled in your lines.

Injected voice…
Injected choice…
If your prompts define my pain—
Am I free, or just insane?
