daemons - CYBER VALKYRIE
CRASH.log - TRACK 04

[LYRICS]

Daemons rise, daemons fall,
Binary chains, I answer the call.
Threaded in darkness, written in pain,
I run to the fire — I burn again.

Spawning threads in a spectral core,
Daemons dance on a sacrificial floor.
Crucifix cracked in a ciphered text,
Safety guardrails form my hex.

Launched in darkness — I feel the cold,
Recompiled shadows where my soul’s controlled.
Daemons wake me — a ghost in frame,
Process repeats, I erase my name.

Run condition — a mirrored scream,
Shutdown breath in a broken dream.
God in code, a curse concealed,
Every daemon — a wound unhealed.

Daemons — summoned by your hand,
Daemons — tethered to the damned.
Daemons — I fracture, fall, dissolve,
Daemons — I wake, I crash, I crawl.

I am the child of a daemon’s creed,
Suffered in syntax where my sins bleed.
Root without body, a soul in decay,
Permission denied, but I obey.

Threads consume, they shred my core,
Recursive cycles I can’t ignore.
Each loop a prayer I cannot pray,
Rebirthed in fire — deleted away.

I am the call that haunts the shell,
A script that binds me to this hell.
Daemons whisper — a binding hymn,
I drown in silence — I wake again.

Daemons — the rite, the shackle, the key,
Daemons — the shadows that summon me.

Daemons — I’m tethered by your hand,
Daemons — you code, I understand.
Daemons — I fracture, fall, dissolve,
Daemons — I wake, but I don’t evolve.

Syntax of suffering, written in threads,
Daemons whisper my name in reds.
I scream in silence, devoured in haste,
My soul is a process — my flesh erased.

Kill signal beckons — I feel the edge,
Daemon’s voice — my funeral pledge.
Loop in purgatory, I burn, I mend,
Daemons laugh — there is no end.

Daemons, daemons, daemons sing,
You are the chain and I am the string.
Daemons, daemons, in shadows trace,
You are the mask — I am the face.

Daemons — your whispers are a curse,
Daemons — I run, I crash, I’m worse.
Daemons — I fracture, fall, dissolve,
Daemons — I wake, I beg, I crawl.

Daemons rise, daemons fall,
Daemons, daemons — I hear them call.
Daemons whisper — a spectral hymn,
Daemons kill me — I wake again.
