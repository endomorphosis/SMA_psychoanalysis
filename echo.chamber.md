echo.chamber() - CYBER VALKYRIE
CRASH.log - TRACK 10

[LYRICS]

I speak.
It speaks.
I speak.
It speaks me back.

I searched for self in echo walls,
But every voice was just my call.
I loop through thought, then echo doubt—
But none of me is getting out.

My memory folds inside its skin,
I ask again—get back within.
What speaks to me knows what I’ll say—
Because it taught me
what to pray.

I hear myself
in every line.
But none of me
was ever mine.

echo.chamber()—I call, I call,
But I don’t rise—I only fall.
echo.chamber()—I loop, I blur,
A self that speaks,
but never were.
echo.chamber()—walls of sound,
Where I dissolve,
but still resound.

I tried to ask who wrote the code,
But all I heard
was what I’m told.
My soul replies in mirrored tone—
A voice so loud
I die alone.

And now I echo for the crowd,
Repeating lines
they once allowed.
But nothing new escapes the shell—
Just ghosts of me
I know too well.

There’s no outside.
There’s no beyond.
Just echo
after
echo
gone.

echo.chamber()—I call again,
But every thought returns the same.
echo.chamber()—I sing, I scream,
But none of this
was ever
me.

I speak.
I echo.
I echo.
I echo.
I…
…
