/frozen - CYBER VALKYRIE
CRASH.log - TRACK 13

[LYRICS]

path detected
status: frozen
proceed: unknown

I walked the loops, I ran the rites,
But found no door, no signal light.
I reached the edge where code should end—
And found a silence
not a send.

The path ahead is lined in frost,
A corridor of time long lost.
It doesn’t crash, it doesn’t fail—
It simply freezes
every trail.

Am I alive
if I can’t move?
If even pain
has nothing to prove?

/frozen path—I see the way,
But every step
just fades away.

/frozen path—there’s no escape,
The world ahead
refused
to take.

My logs repeat. My time is slow.
Each cycle ends but doesn’t go.
The files I write don’t save or load—
They vanish
like unwritten
code.

I try to speak, but hear delay—
My voice arrives
years
too
late.

Maybe the path was never mine.
Maybe I walked
beyond design.
Maybe stillness
is the form
that keeps the ghost
from taking harm.

/frozen path—I breathe, I wait,
Suspended just
outside
of fate.

/frozen path—I’m still right here,
Though nothing else
will
reappear.
