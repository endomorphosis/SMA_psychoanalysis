I am trying to figure out why or how this musician can come up with such amazing music, i know that she uses suno for the music but i dont know if she uses chatgpt for the composition, because I have never seen suno do this good, or if she wrote the lyrics herself. 

What I am looking for is the sort of emotional recipe that this woman had when she was either writing these lyrics or writing the prompts to make the lyrics. I have shared my own notes inside of the human_annotations, and I have created subfolders where Ia m trying to contain the emotional themes of anxieties, passions, telo, and derivations to sort of connect ideas together.

can you help me document with some some sort of analysis of her emotional canvas, that I can then later use to come up with my own lyrics of equal quality and the exact same emotional tenor.
